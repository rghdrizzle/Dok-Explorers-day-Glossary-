# AI/ML
Welcome to AI/ML glossary 

This glossary covers the most important and relevant terms related to AI/ML, and each term is defined

| Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Artificial Intelligence | The ability of machines to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation. |
| Machine Learning | A type of AI that allows machines to learn and improve from experience, without being explicitly programmed. |
| Deep Learning | A subfield of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers to learn and recognize patterns in data. |
| Neural Network | A computational model inspired by the structure and function of the human brain, used in machine learning to learn and recognize patterns in data. |
| Natural Language Processing (NLP) | A subfield of AI that focuses on the interaction between computers and human languages, including tasks such as language translation, sentiment analysis, and chatbot conversations. |
| Supervised Learning | A type of machine learning where the model is trained on labeled data, and learns to predict labels for new, unseen data. |
| Unsupervised Learning | A type of machine learning where the model is trained on unlabeled data, and learns to find patterns and structure in the data without being told what to look for. |
| Data Science | The interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from data. |
| Model | In machine learning, a mathematical representation of a system or process, used to make predictions or decisions based on data. |
| Model Training |  It is the process of teaching an artificial intelligence (AI) system, such as a machine learning algorithm, to recognize patterns in data and make predictions or classifications based on those patterns. In this process, a model is created using a set of training data, and then the model is refined through an iterative process until it can accurately predict outcomes or classify new data. The goal of model training is to create a model that can generalize well to new, unseen data and make accurate predictions or classifications
| Training Data | Training data is a set of data that is used to train a machine learning model. The goal of machine learning is to teach an algorithm to recognize patterns and make predictions based on input data. To do this, the algorithm needs to be trained on a set of data that contains examples of the patterns it is meant to recognize. This set of data is called the training data
| Validation Data | Validation data, also known as validation set, is a set of data that is used to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model during the training process. After training on the training data, the machine learning algorithm needs to be evaluated on new, unseen data to assess its performance and to ensure that it is not overfitting to the training data
| Testing Data | Testing data, also known as a test set, is a set of data that is used to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model after it has been trained on the training data and evaluated on the validation data. The purpose of the testing data is to provide a final evaluation of the model's performance on new, unseen data.
| Machine Learning Pipeline | A machine learning pipeline refers to the series of steps involved in building and deploying a machine learning model.The pipeline typically consists of `Data Collection`  `Data Preprocessing` `Feature Engineering` `Model Selection` `Model Training` `Model Evaluation` `Model Deployment`
